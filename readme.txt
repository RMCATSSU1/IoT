Welcome to our LoRa project repository, where you'll find the code for Arduino, ESP8266, and MATLAB. 

Within this directory, you'll also find a .zip file containing a Ham Radio capture example. Experiment with the decimation values and observe how they affect the captured audio.

Navigate to the EE570_IoT_LoRa directory to explore the LoRa project-specific code.

The file "2mAmatuerRadioCapture.zip" is one of the excersises for later on. We will use GNU Radio to decode a ham radio broadcast.

MainWebpageCode.php is the main page of our LoRa based IoT project.

DataBaseUrlDataPushingPAhe.php is the page that we use to send data received by our edge node to our database.

data.php is the page that reads the database and puts the stored data into a .json format.
